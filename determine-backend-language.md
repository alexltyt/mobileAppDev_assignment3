# Determination of Backend Language for the University Social Networking App

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 5 Oct 2023

## Context

An essential part of developing our university social networking app is selecting an appropriate backend language. The backend will handle data processing, authentication, database operations, and more. Its efficiency, scalability, and speed will be instrumental in determining the app's overall performance and user satisfaction.

## Decision

**Choice:** Node.js

### Rationale

- **Asynchronous Nature:** Node.js operates on a non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications.
- **Single Language Across Stack:** With our hybrid approach for mobile app development, using JavaScript-based frameworks, having Node.js as the backend allows for JavaScript usage throughout the entire development stack. This can streamline development processes and reduce context-switching for developers.
- **Vast Package Library:** The Node Package Manager (NPM) provides a plethora of libraries and tools, speeding up the development process and offering solutions for various requirements.
- **Scalability:** Node.js is designed with scalability in mind, making it apt for applications like ours that could experience variable user traffic.
- **Community Support:** A robust community backs Node.js. This ensures regular updates, a wealth of plugins, and easy access to solutions for potential challenges.

## Consequences

- **Performance Limitations:** While Node.js is excellent for I/O bound operations, CPU-bound tasks can be a bottleneck. Optimizations and careful design considerations will be required.
- **Callback Hell:** Node.js, with its asynchronous nature, can lead to "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom". However, with modern solutions like `async/await`, this challenge has been largely mitigated.
- **Learning Curve:** If the development team is more accustomed to traditional, synchronous programming models, there might be an initial learning curve with Node.js's event-driven model.
