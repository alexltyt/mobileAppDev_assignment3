# Implementation of Permission System for the University Social Networking App

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 4 Oct 2023

## Context

In an environment like a university, there are varied roles, from students to professors to administrative staff. Each of these roles has distinct functionalities and accesses within the app. Implementing a systematic permission system is paramount to ensure data integrity, privacy, and role-specific functionalities.

## Decision

**Choice:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Rationale

- **Granular Control:** RBAC provides a granular control mechanism where permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to these roles. This ensures that a user only has the permissions of their assigned role(s).
- **Simplicity and Scalability:** As the app scales and potentially introduces more roles or functionalities, RBAC allows for easy scalability without needing to redefine permissions for each user.
- **Audit and Compliance:** RBAC can help in ensuring compliance with university regulations and policies. With predefined roles, auditing and monitoring become more straightforward.
- **Flexibility:** New roles can be easily created, and permissions can be adjusted without having to individually update each user's permissions.

## Consequences

- **Maintenance Overhead:** As the app evolves, ensuring that roles and permissions align with updated functionalities can be a maintenance task. Periodic reviews will be necessary.
- **Potential for Misconfiguration:** While RBAC provides granularity, there's also a risk of misconfiguration. Proper testing and validation processes should be in place to avoid any accidental data exposures or functionality mishaps.
- **User Onboarding:** When onboarding new users or changing roles, care must be taken to assign the appropriate roles, ensuring users get the correct set of permissions.
