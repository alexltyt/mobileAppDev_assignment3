# Ensuring App Accessibility for All Users

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 5 Oct 2023

## Context

The university's demographic will encompass individuals from varied backgrounds, including those with disabilities. Ensuring that the app remains accessible to every user irrespective of their physical or cognitive abilities is not just a moral imperative but a fundamental design philosophy.

## Decision

**Choice:** Implement accessibility widgets in Flutter and adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

### Rationale

- **Universal Design:** By incorporating Flutter's accessibility widgets and adhering to WCAG, we're building the app with a universal design approach, ensuring all students and professors can interact with the app seamlessly.
- **Legal & Ethical Compliance:** Adhering to internationally recognized standards like WCAG ensures that the app complies with potential legal requirements around accessibility. It also demonstrates a commitment to ethical design.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Accessibility features often enhance usability for all users, not just those they're specifically designed for.

## Consequences

- **Development Time:** Integrating comprehensive accessibility features might extend the initial development time. However, this is a worthy investment considering the long-term benefits.
- **Training & Awareness:** The development team might require some training or resources to familiarize themselves with all the accessibility widgets and best practices in Flutter. Furthermore, continuous awareness and updates on accessibility standards will ensure the app remains compliant with any future revisions in the WCAG or other recognized standards.
