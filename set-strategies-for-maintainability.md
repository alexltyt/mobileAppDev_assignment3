# Implementing Strategies for App Maintainability

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 5 Oct 2023

## Context

As the university social networking app evolves, it will undergo multiple changes, enhancements, and potential bug fixes. It's imperative that the app's codebase remains clean, organized, and well-documented to ensure easy maintainability over time and facilitate smooth onboarding for new developers or team members.

## Decision

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Code Organization:** Adopt a well-structured and modular code organization approach.
2. **Version Control:** Implement version control using Git.
3. **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive code and architectural documentation.

### Rationale

- **Code Organization:** Modularizing code into reusable components and following clear naming conventions ensures that the app remains scalable. This approach makes debugging easier and facilitates the addition of new features.
- **Version Control with Git:** Git provides a robust platform for tracking changes, collaborating among developers, and managing different versions of the app. A branching strategy will further streamline feature additions and bug fixes.
- **Thorough Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation ensures that any developer, whether they've been on the project since day one or just joined the team, can understand, modify, and enhance the app without unnecessary delays.

## Consequences

- **Initial Setup Time:** Setting up a structured codebase, defining branching strategies in Git, and initiating documentation might add to the initial setup time. However, this is a time investment that will pay dividends in the long run.
- **Periodic Review:** To ensure that the maintainability strategies remain effective, periodic code reviews and documentation audits will be essential.
- **Team Training:** Team members might need training or workshops to get accustomed to the defined strategies and best practices, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
